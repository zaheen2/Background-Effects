    <h1>About CSS</h1>
    <div id="div1">
        <p><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is an essential language in web development used to describe the presentation of documents written in HTML or XML. It allows developers to control the layout, design, and visual appearance of web pages without altering the underlying structure of the content. By separating content (HTML) from design (CSS), it becomes easier to maintain, update, and scale websites. This separation of concerns improves workflow efficiency, making web pages more adaptable and easier to manage over time.</b></p><br>
        <p><b>One of the core advantages of CSS is its ability to consistently apply styles across multiple pages of a website. Through the use of external style sheets, developers can define rules for fonts, colors, spacing, and layout once and then reuse them across various pages. This ensures that the website maintains a unified look and feel, enhancing user experience by providing consistency in design. CSS also offers flexibility by allowing styles to be applied selectively. Through different types of selectors, specific elements or groups of elements can be targeted for styling, allowing precise control over how content is displayed.</b></p><br>
        <p><b>CSS operates on a cascading hierarchy, meaning that styles can be inherited or overridden depending on specificity. This system allows for flexibility in design and ensures that developers can prioritize certain styles when needed. For example, if a general rule is applied to all paragraphs but a more specific rule is given to a particular class of paragraphs, the latter will take precedence. This cascading behavior allows developers to create more complex, yet manageable, stylesheets.</b></p><br>
        <p><b>Another significant feature of CSS is its support for responsive design, which is increasingly important as users access websites on a variety of devices with different screen sizes. CSS media queries enable developers to define different styles for different screen widths, ensuring that websites look good on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. This adaptability is crucial in modern web development, where providing a seamless experience across platforms is a priority.</b></p><br>

    <p><b>In recent years, CSS has evolved to include powerful layout tools like Flexbox and Grid. These modules have simplified the process of creating complex layouts, providing more intuitive ways to control the alignment, spacing, and distribution of elements on a page. Flexbox excels at managing the distribution of space along a single axis, making it ideal for responsive navigation bars or vertically centered content. On the other hand, CSS Grid is more powerful for creating two-dimensional layouts, allowing developers to design intricate page structures with ease.</b></p><br>

Its separation of content from design, cascading nature, and adaptability across devices make it indispensable in modern web development. The continued evolution of CSS, with the addition of new features and frameworks, ensures that it remains a cornerstone of creating functional and aesthetically pleasing web applications.</b></p><br>
